# What is this (EONShell)?
**EONShell** lets you manage your PC through any device, from any location. <br>Even without needing to connect to the same Internet.

# Why did we develop it?
At the start, @p0unter and I (@mal1kore1ss) were bored, so we said, "What if we do a thing like this?" and I don't know‚Äîit just popped up and we started developing it. Also, helping people, etc. (it's a lie; it's just fun developing).

# How does it work?
The client gets shell access from the device to be controlled by doing bind-shell. Then it uses the **core** to run commands on the device.

# When will it work?
As an example: we have a guy named "Harun"‚Äîhe's a teenage boy who watches dirty adult stuff.<br>Then he forgets to close the browser tab where he watched that dirty thing, but there's an issue: he's not at homeüíÄ<br>

> Case 1: He has **"EONShell"**  
He can basically turn off his computer using **EONShell**, which will save him from getting pissed off by his family.

> Case 2: He doesn't have **"EONShell"**  
His family will piss him off. (R.I.P lil broüôè)
